# Tasks timer (productivity tool)

## Resume

The goal of this project is to learn and practice frontend development skills by building a Pomodoro Timer, a productivity tool based on the Pomodoro Technique.
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals (typically 25 minutes) separated by short breaks.

## Requirements

You will create a Pomodoro Timer web application using the frontend framework of your choice e.g. React, Vue or Angular. Here is the list of requirements for the application:

- User should be able to start stop and resume a pomodoro timer (timer reset and customization options).
- User should be able to configure the default interval configuration;
  default work session should be 25 minutes, short break should be 5 minutes and longer break after 4 work sessions should be 15 minutes.
- Application should display the current session type (e.g., Work, Short Break, Long Break) and a tasks list with completion tracking
- It should also track the number of tracked work sessions
- Play a sound when a session ends to notify the user (notifications can be a plus)
- Ensure the app is accessible and visually appealing on both desktop and mobile devices.
  You can use any existing pomodoro apps for the UI inspiration e.g.

[time.fyi - Pomodoro Timer](https://time.fyi/pomodoro)
[Pomofocus - Pomodoro Tracker](https://pomofocus.io/)

## Technical Requirements

Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or a frontend framework/library such as React, Vue, or Angular).
Implement state management for the timer, session tracking, task analytics (with Pinia and Local Storage).
Use a modular and reusable code structure.
User-friendly UI with Tailwind CSS.
Maintain proper accessibility standards (e.g., keyboard navigation, ARIA labels).
For notifications, use Notification API.
